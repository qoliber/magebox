## MageBox

MageBox is an open-source project created to provide Magento developers with the fastest possible local development experience. By running PHP and Nginx natively while containerizing supporting services, MageBox eliminates the performance overhead of traditional Docker-based solutions.

## About Me

I'm Jakub Winkler — software engineer, open-source contributor, public speaker, Magento Association Board Member, and Magento Community Council member. I've spent the last decade helping companies build and maintain eCommerce platforms without losing their budgets, their patience, or their sanity.

I work at the intersection of technology and pragmatism: fewer buzzwords, more real solutions. Whether I'm building tools, reviewing architectures, or fixing eCommerce projects that went off the rails, my goal is always the same — make the web faster, cleaner, cheaper to maintain, and fully under your control.

I'm the author of **Open Source eCommerce: Uncensored** — a brutally honest guide to agencies, vendors, technical debt, and the real mechanics of online store development. If you want to understand how this industry really works (and how not to get burned), you can grab the book here:
